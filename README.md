# TR-808

## Description
A fun beat making tool that allows you to input sounds, and create music.

## Project goals
I want to learn more about python and other packages such as pygame, by building a playable drum machine.
pygame seems like it has alot of functionality to offer, wish me luck!

## Start it up
- open up terminal at file directory
- activate the virtual enviornment
    - `source .venv/bin/activate`
- install requirements.txt file
    - `pip instal -r requirements.txt`
- run it with this command
    - `python main.py`
- start making your first beat

## Latest Updates
- created the main window
- created the run time parameters
- created draw grid function to update display
- added 2 divisions, one for instrument text, and one to house the lower menu
- added text to the screen
- added beats and instruments variable to build upon in future
- used beats and instruments variables to aid in building correct number of pads vertically and horizontally
- added grid to spacially define non functional pads
